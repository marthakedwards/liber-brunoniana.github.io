<p>Henry Dexter Sharpe (<a href="articles/1872.html">1872</a>-<a href="articles/1954.html">1954</a>), twelfth chancellor of Brown University, graduated in <a href="articles/1894.html">1894</a>. Five years after his graduation he became president of Brown and Sharpe Manufacturing Company after the death of his father. Only ten years after his graduation he was named a trustee of the University. He served on the <a href="articles/Corporation.html">Corporation</a> for fifty years, on the Advisory and Executive Committee for 39 years, and on the Investment Committee for 38 years. He was chancellor for twenty years, from <a href="articles/1932.html">1932</a> to <a href="articles/1952.html">1952</a>. In <a href="articles/1936.html">1936</a> he was named chairman of the University Council, a group formed to work out a long-term program for increasing Brownâ€™s financial resources. Residing very close to the University at 84 Prospect Street (his home is now <a href="articles/Rochambeau House.html">Rochambeau House</a>), Sharpe was able to lend his active influence as well as his financial assistance to Brown. In <a href="articles/1927.html">1927</a> he donated five fellowships to the <a href="articles/Graduate School.html">Graduate School</a>, in the Departments of <a href="articles/Biology.html">Biology</a>, <a href="articles/English.html">English</a>, <a href="articles/History.html">History</a>, <a href="articles/Mathematics.html">Mathematics</a>, and Romance Languages. He donated over $200,000 to the Housing and Development Campaign in the 1940s, and at his suggestion his donation was the principal funding of the new classroom building, <a href="articles/Whitehall.html">Whitehall</a>, which was such a radical departure from the traditional architecture of the campus. When he died on May 17, <a href="articles/1954.html">1954</a>, his largest public bequest was to Brown.</p>
