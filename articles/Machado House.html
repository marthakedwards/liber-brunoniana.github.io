The house, property of the <a href="articles/Rhode Island School of Design.html">Rhode Island School of Design</a> after Miss Sharpeâ€™s death in <a href="articles/1953.html">1953</a>, was purchased by Brown in <a href="articles/1955.html">1955</a> and used as a small dormitory for women students. An extension at the rear of the building was designed by Steven L. Lerner and added in <a href="articles/1975.html">1975</a>. At a ceremony on November 10, <a href="articles/1989.html">1989</a> the building was formally renamed Antonio Machado House in honor of the Spanish poet. A bust of Machado by sculptor Pablo Serrano acquired by the University in <a href="articles/1967.html">1967</a> was moved from the <a href="articles/Annmary Brown Memorial.html">Annmary Brown Memorial</a> to the garden of the house.</p>
