<p>The Brown Office Building on Thayer Street opened in <a href="articles/1970.html">1970</a>. The four story building designed by Kent, Cruise Associates was built of concrete, the sides having been pre-cast in Worcester and delivered to the site in large sections. Into the building moved the departments of purchasing, buildings and grounds, safety, personnel, budget, grants and contracts, controller, and data processing, along with the East Side branch of the Rhode Island Hospital Trust Bank and the college bookstore. Before the move, the bookstore had been in <a href="articles/Faunce House.html">Faunce House</a> with an annex in <a href="articles/Whitehall.html">Whitehall</a> for textbooks, and Pembroke had its own store in <a href="articles/Pembroke Hall.html">Pembroke Hall</a>. The new bookstore had a trade store at street level with a textbook floor above and a campus shop below.</p>
