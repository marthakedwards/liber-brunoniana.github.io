<p>The Caduceus was the publication of Gamma Nu, a non-secret society. It was first published in December <a href="articles/1865.html">1865</a> as an alternative to the <i><a href="articles/Brown Paper.html">Brown Paper</a>,</i> which was the annual publication of the secret societies. Its first page listed the faculty, the members of <a href="articles/Phi Beta Kappa.html">Phi Beta Kappa</a>, Gamma Nu and the “Oudens,” a group of non-society men, along with the literary societies, the <a href="articles/Philermenian Society.html">Philermenian Society</a> and the <a href="articles/United Brothers.html">United Brothers</a>. After a lapse of three years, another issue of the <i>Caduceus</i> appeared in December <a href="articles/1868.html">1868</a>. In the meantime, the Philermenian and <a href="articles/United Brothers.html">United Brothers</a> societies had ceased to exist, and Gamma Nu had become a chapter of Delta Upsilon, a non-secret fraternity. In <a href="articles/1870.html">1870</a> the <i>Caduceus</i> appeared in magazine form with a literary department added. The issue of <a href="articles/1871.html">1871</a> and the final issue in <a href="articles/1872.html">1872</a> were published by Delta Upsilon and Wayland Literary Societies.</p>
