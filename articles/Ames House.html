<p>Ames House, built about <a href="articles/1830.html">1830</a> by Samuel Ames <a href="articles/1823.html">1823</a> on the corner of Power and Brook Streets, was given to Brown in <a href="articles/1937.html">1937</a> by Mrs. John Ormsbee Ames and Frank Mauran, Jr. Twenty-four rooms were remodeled to house thirty-eight graduate students who moved in the next year. In <a href="articles/1949.html">1949</a>, before the <a href="articles/Wriston Quadrangle.html">Wriston Quadrangle</a> was built, Ames House was deeded to the city of Providence in return for the Thayer Street School, which stood within the confines of the proposed quadrangle. The city razed the building, and replaced it with the Brook Street Fire Station in <a href="articles/1950.html">1950</a>. At that time a dormitory at 15 Benevolent House, which was named Russell House, was renamed Ames House. In <a href="articles/1958.html">1958</a> the name was given to a dormitory at 150 George Street, which was half of the building at the corner of Thayer Street. In <a href="articles/1961.html">1961</a>, when the Department of <a href="articles/Mathematics.html">Mathematics</a> moved into the other half of the house, that section was named <a href="articles/Howell House.html">Howell House</a>, taking its name from the former home of the <a href="articles/Mathematics.html">Mathematics</a> Department on College Street. The building continued to be identified by its two sections, Ames House and <a href="articles/Howell House.html">Howell House</a> until about <a href="articles/1971.html">1971</a>, when the name of <a href="articles/Howell House.html">Howell House</a> was applied to the entire building (now identified as 153-155 Thayer Street).</p>
