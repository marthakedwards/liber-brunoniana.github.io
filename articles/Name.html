<p>The Name, Brown University, was adopted in <a href="articles/1804.html">1804</a>. The <a href="articles/Corporation.html">Corporation</a> empowered by the <a href="articles/Charter.html">Charter</a> in <a href="articles/1764.html">1764</a> was “in Fact and Name to be known by the Name of Trustees, and Fellows of the College or University in the <a href="articles/English.html">English</a> Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations in New England in America the Trustees and Fellows at any time hereafter giving such more particular Name to the College in Honor of the greatest &amp; most distinguished Benefactor or otherwise as they shall think proper ...” Thus the college was known as Rhode Island College, and even sometimes casually referred to as Providence College. <a href="articles/President.html">President</a> Maxcy, in a letter to Richard Furman on October 26, <a href="articles/1795.html">1795</a>, wrote, “This College is still without a <i>name.</i> No benefactor has appeared.” The <a href="articles/Corporation.html">Corporation</a> had passed a resolution at its meeting in September <a href="articles/1795.html">1795</a> that a gift of $6,000 previous to the next <a href="articles/Commencement.html">Commencement</a> would entitle the donor to name the college, but no donor was forthcoming at this time. Again in September <a href="articles/1803.html">1803</a> the <a href="articles/Corporation.html">Corporation</a> voted that a donation of $5,000 within a year would entitle the donor to name the college. On September 6, <a href="articles/1804.html">1804</a>, Nicholas Brown <a href="articles/1786.html">1786</a> donated $5,000 for the establishment of a “Professorship of Oratory &amp; Belles Letters (sic),” and the <a href="articles/Corporation.html">Corporation</a> voted, “That this College be called and known in all future time by the Name of Brown University in Providence in the State of Rhode Island, and Providence Plantations.”</p>
