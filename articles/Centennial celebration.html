<p>The Centennial celebration was held on September 6, <a href="articles/1864.html">1864</a>, one day before <a href="articles/Commencement.html">Commencement</a>, with formal exercises in the <a href="articles/First Baptist Church.html">First Baptist Church</a>. <a href="articles/President.html">President</a> <a href="articles/Sears, Barnas.html">Barnas Sears</a> delivered an historical discourse (57 printed pages) and the Central Glee Club sang an ode written for the occasion by Bishop George Burgess <a href="articles/1826.html">1826</a>. After the exercises seven hundred alumni and guests attended a dinner in a large tent on the campus, and heard speeches by ex-president Wayland and Professor Goldwin Smith of Oxford University, and a poem by Charles Thurber <a href="articles/1827.html">1827</a>. General Ambrose E. Burnside’s remarks were followed by a centennial poem by <a href="articles/Hay, John.html">John Hay</a> <a href="articles/1858.html">1858</a>, read in his absence by Professor James B. Angell <a href="articles/1849.html">1849</a>, which began:</p><blockquote>“A hundred times the bells of Brown<br />Have rung to sleep the idle summers,<br />And still today clangs clamoring down<br />A greeting to the welcome comers.”</blockquote><p>George William Curtis, honorary alumnus, responded to the sentiment, “The Adopted Sons of the University,” and Professor Caswell <a href="articles/1822.html">1822</a> responded to “The Memory of the Founders and Benefactors of the University” by contributing $1000 toward endowment of a professorship as a memorial of the occasion. Several addresses, because of the lateness of the hour, were rescheduled to the commencement dinner the next day, including a 120-line poem by Mark Antony DeWolfe Howe <a href="articles/1828.html">1828</a>.</p>
