<p>West Cottage on Cushing Street was opened in <a href="articles/1915.html">1915</a>, with furnishings provided by the Rhode Island Society for the Collegiate <a href="articles/Education.html">Education</a> of Women, to receive the overflow of women students who could not be accommodated in <a href="articles/Miller Hall.html">Miller Hall</a>. The house was a cooperative dormitory and the year after its opening was designated an honor house. After four years of use West Cottage was torn down to make room for the building of <a href="articles/Metcalf Hall.html">Metcalf Hall</a>.</p>
