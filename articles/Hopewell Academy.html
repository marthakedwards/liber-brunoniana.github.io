<p>Hopewell Academy has often been called the forerunner of Brown University. It was the first educational institution sponsored by the Baptists in the American colonies, and was founded in <a href="articles/1756.html">1756</a> by Rev. Isaac Eaton under the auspices of the Philadelphia and Charleston Association. Although the academy lasted only until <a href="articles/1767.html">1767</a>, many Baptist ministers, as well as some who entered other professions, received the rudiments of an education there. Of these, probably the most important was <a href="articles/Manning, James.html">James Manning</a>, who became the first president of Rhode Island College, later Brown University. <a href="articles/Howell, David.html">David Howell</a>, the first professor at Brown, also studied there. It was the success of Hopewell Academy that, only seven years after its beginning, encouraged the Philadelphia Association to decide to establish a college in Rhode Island.</p>
