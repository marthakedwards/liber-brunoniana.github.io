<p> The Association of Class Officers began as the Association of Class Secretaries in <a href="articles/1902.html">1902</a>, when the Brown Alumni Monthly, scarcely two years old, gave a dinner at the University Club for the secretaries of the classes from <a href="articles/1857.html">1857</a> to <a href="articles/1902.html">1902</a>, hoping to encourage subscriptions to the <i>Monthly,</i> and to organize the secretaries to work for the interests of the University. The Association of Class Secretaries was duly formed and elected George L. Miner <a href="articles/1897.html">1897</a> its first secretary. The Association helped to start <a href="articles/Homecoming.html">Homecoming</a> weekend and <a href="articles/Alumni Field Day.html">Alumni Field Day</a>. A few years after the merger of Brown and Pembroke, the Association included Pembroke secretaries. The next admitted to membership were the class presidents, and by <a href="articles/1977.html">1977</a>, after the vice-presidents and treasurers of the classes were admitted, the group became the Association of Class Officers.</p>
