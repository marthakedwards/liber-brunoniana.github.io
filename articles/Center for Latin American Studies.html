<p>The Center for Latin American Studies was established in November <a href="articles/1984.html">1984</a> to foster teaching and research on Latin America, using faculty from various departments who have taught or studied in Latin America. Courses have also been taught by visiting professors and by postdoctoral fellows doing research at the John Carter Brown <a href="articles/Library.html">Library</a>. The Center maintains an active exchange program. About 20 Brown students study each year in Latin American countries. An exchange program with El Colegio de México enables Brown students to do research there, and under another program Brown students learn Spanish at the Universidad de las Américas in Puebla, México at a summer program or during the academic year. The Center is one of thirteen federally supported Latin American Resource Centers, and with the University of Connecticut and the University of Massachusetts-Amherst forms a consortium, which has organized several conferences, including “Venezuela at the End of the Century/Venezuela: Sociedad y Cultura al Dinal del Siglo” in <a href="articles/1991.html">1991</a>. Directors of the Center have been José Amor y Vázquez, Dwight B. Heath, and Thomas E. Skidmore.</p>
