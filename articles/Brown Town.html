<p>Brown Town was the name given to the temporary housing for veterans of <a href="articles/World War II.html">World War II</a> which was erected in <a href="articles/1946.html">1946</a> near <a href="articles/Marvel Gymnasium.html">Marvel Gymnasium</a> on the city-owned Sessions Street playground at the corner of Elmgrove Avenue and Sessions Street. There were one hundred housing units in eight former Navy barracks which were brought in sections from the Coddington Point site in Newport and set up on cement posts. At one time the hundred families in Brown Town had a total of 120 children. Half of the apartment buildings were removed in <a href="articles/1950.html">1950</a>, and the rest were taken down in June <a href="articles/1951.html">1951</a>, when almost all the married veterans had finished their education.</p>
