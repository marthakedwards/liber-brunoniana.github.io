<p>The American Band played at Brown graduations from at least <a href="articles/1847.html">1847</a>, when Brown paid eighty dollars for its services. The band was called the American Brass Band in <a href="articles/1837.html">1837</a> when it emerged as a reorganization of the Providence Brass Band founded in <a href="articles/1826.html">1826</a> by Joe Greene. David Wallis Reeves became the leader in <a href="articles/1866.html">1866</a>. Reeves wrote more than one hundred marches and he “adapted” the Brown <a href="articles/Commencement.html">Commencement</a> March, which has been played during the procession to the <a href="articles/First Baptist Church.html">First Baptist Church</a> since <a href="articles/1869.html">1869</a> and was first published as a piano solo in <a href="articles/1891.html">1891</a>. The traditional music for the procession as it returned up the hill was “The Second Connecticut Regiment,” another march by Reeves. The band played for Commencements until <a href="articles/1970.html">1970</a>, after which the Brown Band accompanied the procession.</p>
