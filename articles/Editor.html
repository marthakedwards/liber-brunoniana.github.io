<p>The <i>Editor</i> was published for the first time in the spring of <a href="articles/1958.html">1958</a> and sold for 25 cents. The editorial in the first issue announced the reason for the founding of the magazine, “We feel that the generation which has matured since <a href="articles/World War II.html">World War II</a> has created a considerable body of writing able to see with the eyes of youth and speak expressively on a number of themes. But there exists no medium sufficiently interested in publishing the work of the dawning writers. ... Our magazine is a joint effort of students at Harvard and Brown. Our emphasis is on the young writing in the college community; our contributors range from the undergraduate to the graduate student to the young faculty member. Whether there will be a second issue depends largely on the reception of the first.” There were only two more issues, the final one printed in the summer of <a href="articles/1959.html">1959</a>. Stephen Kaye ’59 and Gerald Bunker were the editors. The <i>Editor</i> contained poetry by <a href="articles/Philbrick, Charles H..html">Charles Philbrick</a> ’44 and Daniel Hughes ’58 Ph.D., poetry and prose by Stephen Oberbeck ’60, and illustrations by <a href="articles/Rhode Island School of Design.html">Rhode Island School of Design</a> students.</p>
