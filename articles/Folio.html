<p>Folio No. 1 was a mimeographed “magazine of experiment ... devoted frankly to creative talent” which came out in December <a href="articles/1931.html">1931</a> and sold for fifteen cents. One hundred copies were printed, of which eighty were for sale. The publication had no campus organization behind it and accepted writings of undergraduates and graduates. Among its offerings were stories by J. Saunders Redding and J. H. Wildman and poetry by W. T. Scott and Duncan Emrich. On the day that the only issue was printed there appeared by coincidence the fake copy of <i><a href="articles/Brown Bedel.html">Brown Bedel</a></i> and also a fake issue of the <i><a href="articles/Pembroke Record.html">Pembroke Record</a>.</i></p>
