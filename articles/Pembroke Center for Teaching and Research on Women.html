<p>The Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women was established in <a href="articles/1981.html">1981</a> and was dedicated in March <a href="articles/1982.html">1982</a> during Women’s <a href="articles/History.html">History</a> Week. Grants had been received from the Ford Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities for a study of “Cultural Constructions of the Female.” Professor Joan Scott was named director of the Center, and a concentration in women’s studies was added to the curriculum. Later directors of the Center have been Barbara Babcock and Karen Newman. The Center, although not an academic department with its own faculty, supports the interdisciplinary women’s studies program and the integration of gender into undergraduate courses. The Center also brings post-doctoral scholars to Brown and conducts frequent seminars.</p>
