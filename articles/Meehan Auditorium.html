Meehan Auditorium for the donor of half a million dollars for its construction, the facility filled the need for a skating rink and large auditorium for indoor functions, and was the first building of the new athletic plant at <a href="articles/Aldrich-Dexter Field.html">Aldrich-Dexter Field</a>. The building was designed by Perry, Shaw, Hepburn &amp; <a href="articles/Dean.html">Dean</a>; the consulting engineers were Nichols, Norton and Zaldastani; the contractor was the Gilbane Building Company. Its 208-foot diameter steel Schwedler dome covers an ice area of 200 by 85 feet, the maximum size for intercollegiate hockey. There are <a href="articles/2100.html">2100</a> permanent seats painted brown, red and yellow, the colors in the Brown coat of arms.
