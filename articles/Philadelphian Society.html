<p>The Phildelphian Society was a fraternal organization of the 1820s, dedicated to liberty and learning. A manuscript entitled “An Oration delivered before the Phildelphian Society, Freshman Class, Brown University, March <a href="articles/1822.html">1822</a> by Onslow Peters a member” attests to the existence of the society in the absence of other records. Peters’ charge to the membership was, “Proceed as you have done since the formation of this society ... Your names shall be immortal: &amp; when they are frequently reiterated by all ages, sexes &amp; nations of the world, those which by the lower orders of mankind, are counted noble &amp; honourable, in viewing your emblazoned station, shall be heard to exclaim, ‘I too belonged to the Philadelphian Society.’”</p>
