<p>Sam Walter Foss (<a href="articles/1858.html">1858</a>-<a href="articles/1911.html">1911</a>), librarian and poet, was born in Candia, New Hampshire, on June 19, <a href="articles/1858.html">1858</a>. He graduated from Brown in <a href="articles/1882.html">1882</a>, and was considered one of Brown’s illustrious graduates (his name is on the mace), although his name is not often recognized today. At Brown he was chosen class poet in <a href="articles/1882.html">1882</a>. After graduation he became editor of the <i>Lynn Union</i> and writer of a humorous column. In <a href="articles/1887.html">1887</a> he was editor of the <i>Yankee Blade,</i> a literary weekly in Boston. He was librarian of the Somerville (Mass.) Public <a href="articles/Library.html">Library</a> from <a href="articles/1898.html">1898</a> until his death on February 26, <a href="articles/1911.html">1911</a> in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He used to write a poem a day for the newspapers, and his five volumes of collected poetry are of the frank and homely “common man” variety. He is best known for his poem, “The House by the Side of the Road,” which ends:<br />   “Let me live in a house by the side of the road<br />   And be a friend to man.”</p>
