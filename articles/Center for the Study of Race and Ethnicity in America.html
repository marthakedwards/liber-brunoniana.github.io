<p>The Center for the study of race and ethnicity in America was established in July <a href="articles/1988.html">1988</a> with professor of philosophy John Ladd as acting director, in response to a proposal which evolved from discussions among Ladd, professor of sociology Martin Martel and associate professor of history Rhett Jones. The objective of the center is the development of academic resources for racial and ethnic studies through lectures, courses, multidisciplinary cooperation and added faculty, and links with other similar programs in other institutions. The Center publishes a newsletter which notes activities relating to race at Brown or elsewhere.</p>
