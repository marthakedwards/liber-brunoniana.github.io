<p>Pi Kappa, was a junior society, said to be “reinstituted in <a href="articles/1900.html">1900</a>.” In the <i><a href="articles/Liber Brunensis.html">Liber Brunensis</a>,</i> beginning in <a href="articles/1901.html">1901</a>, the list of members of Pi Kappa appears, under this heading, “<a href="articles/1864.html">1864</a>-<a href="articles/1894.html">1894</a> Re-Instituted <a href="articles/1900.html">1900</a>.” Whether Pi Kappa existed at an earlier date is uncertain. The <i><a href="articles/Brown Paper.html">Brown Paper</a></i> includes in November <a href="articles/1864.html">1864</a> and again in November <a href="articles/1865.html">1865</a> a society called “Pi Kappa Fraternitas,” with a list of members whose names are decidedly fictitious. The revived society, if such it was, presented during <a href="articles/Junior Week.html">Junior Week</a> in April <a href="articles/1901.html">1901</a> a farce entitled “Through Thick and Thin” in Lyman Gymnasium, which the <i>Brown Daily Herald</i> described as “not at all pretentious in plot or length,” but “bright and witty.” The annual farce became a tradition of Pi Kappa, which also assumed the function of host to visiting athletic teams. New members were traditionally announced at the junior prom in a ceremony at midnight in which they were “tapped” by the outgoing members. When Pi Kappa was replaced by the <a href="articles/Brown Key.html">Brown Key</a> in <a href="articles/1930.html">1930</a>, the retiring members tapped the new Key members.</p>
