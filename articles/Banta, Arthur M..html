<p>Arthur Mangun Banta (<a href="articles/1877.html">1877</a>-<a href="articles/1946.html">1946</a>), professor of biology, was born in Greenwood, Indiana, on December 31, <a href="articles/1877.html">1877</a>. After receiving a bachelor of science degree from Central Normal College in Danville, Indiana, in <a href="articles/1898.html">1898</a>, he earned a bachelor of arts degree in <a href="articles/1903.html">1903</a> and a master of arts degree in <a href="articles/1904.html">1904</a> at the University of Indiana, where he began his work under Carl Eigenmann, investigating fauna of a local cave. After receiving his Ph.D. degree from Harvard in <a href="articles/1907.html">1907</a>, he became professor of biology at Marietta College. Beginning in <a href="articles/1909.html">1909</a>, he conducted research at the Cold Spring Harbor (Long Island) Station for Experimental Evolution of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. He came to Brown in <a href="articles/1929.html">1929</a> as visiting professor of biology and was named research professor the following year. In <a href="articles/1939.html">1939</a> the Carnegie Institution published Bantaâ€™s <i>Studies on the Physiology, Genetics and Evolution of some Cladocera</i> (water flea), which he had researched at Cold Spring Harbor and completed at Brown after a temporary setback when two suitcases which contained the results of five years of his research were stolen from his locked car in New York City. His life work was to be one subject, the influence of the environment on the development of inherited characteristics of animals. He retired from teaching in June of <a href="articles/1945.html">1945</a>, with the intention of concluding some of his investigations, but died on January 2, <a href="articles/1946.html">1946</a>, his great work still unfulfilled.</p>
