<p>Rochambeau House at 84 Prospect Street was the home of Chancellor <a href="articles/Sharpe, Henry D. 1894.html">Henry D. Sharpe</a> <a href="articles/1894.html">1894</a>, which his wife, Mary Elizabeth Sharpe, helped architect Arthur Rice design in <a href="articles/1929.html">1929</a>. Mrs. Sharpe, who died in <a href="articles/1985.html">1985</a>, asked that the house be given to Brown after her death. The building was renovated to provide a home for the Departments of French and of Hispanic and Italian Studies, conveniently located across the street from the former home of Mr. Sharpeâ€™s sister at 87 Prospect Street, which had been a dormitory for Spanish, French, and Italian concentrators.</p>
