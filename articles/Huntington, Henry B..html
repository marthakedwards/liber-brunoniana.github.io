<p>Henry Barrett Huntington (<a href="articles/1875.html">1875</a>-<a href="articles/1965.html">1965</a>), professor of <a href="articles/English.html">English</a>, was born in Malden, Massachusetts, on January 17, <a href="articles/1875.html">1875</a>. He prepared for college at St. Paul’s School in Concord, New Hampshire, and graduated from Harvard in <a href="articles/1897.html">1897</a>. He taught at Dartmouth and Harvard before coming to Brown in <a href="articles/1902.html">1902</a> as assistant professor of <a href="articles/English.html">English</a>. He was promoted to associate professor in <a href="articles/1910.html">1910</a> and professor in <a href="articles/1929.html">1929</a>. His course in “Argumentative Composition” and its companion course, “Principles of Argumentation,” trained students in “correct and vigorous oral presentation of ideas.” When his course in argumentation ceased to be a required course, thirty upperclassmen elected it anyway, and showed their appreciation at the end of the term by presenting him with a cup engraved “Company I. Volunteers.” In addition to teaching, he did volunteer coaching of successful debating teams. With George Pierce Baker he wrote <i>Principles of Argumentation,</i> published in <a href="articles/1925.html">1925</a>. He died in Providence on October 14, <a href="articles/1965.html">1965</a> at the age of ninety. </p>
