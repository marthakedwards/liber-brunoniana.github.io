<p>Taliesin was a literary journal “published by the Evanescent Publishing Company,” of which two issues appeared in <a href="articles/1967.html">1967</a>. The journal, reproduced from typed copy, had a castle on its cover, representing its title, “Llys Y Bardd Taliesin,” translated, “the castle of Taliesin.”  Taliesin was a fifth century Welsh poet. The announced intention of the publication was “to be a forum for unusual views, minority opinions, or any ideas whose advocates may have difficulty finding an audience.” All contributions were welcome so long as they “represent the sincere opinions of their contributors.”</p>
