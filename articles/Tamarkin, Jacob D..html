<p>Jacob David Tamarkin (<a href="articles/1888.html">1888</a>-<a href="articles/1945.html">1945</a>), professor of mathematics, was born in Chernigov in the Ukraine on July 11, <a href="articles/1888.html">1888</a>. He was educated at the Gymnasium of Emperor Alexander I in St. Petersburg, graduating in <a href="articles/1906.html">1906</a>. He received the diploma of the first degree (the equivalent of a Ph.D.) from the University of St. Petersburg in <a href="articles/1910.html">1910</a>, and became an instructor at the University. In <a href="articles/1917.html">1917</a> he received the higher degree of Master of Applied <a href="articles/Mathematics.html">Mathematics</a>, and was appointed professor. He also taught at the School of Railroads and the Electro-Technical School. In <a href="articles/1920.html">1920</a> he was given a leave of absence while he organized the Mathematical Institute of the University of Perm while serving as dean of the physico-mathematical faculty. In Leningrad he occupied a large apartment with two grand pianos. Shostakovitch came to play at Tamarkinâ€™s, and the son of Rimsky-Korsakov was the second violinist in the amateur string quartet which gathered there to play through the night, taking an intermission for a banquet at midnight.</p><p>Tamarkin wanted to leave Russia. The opportunity arrived when he met a Dartmouth professor of mathematics in the summer of <a href="articles/1924.html">1924</a> and they talked of a possible opening for him there. The next year the offer was confirmed when Tamarkin received a picture post card which stated merely that the weather was fine in Hanover. One day he left home and family, took a train and later forded a river to arrive at Riga and present himself, somewhat disheveled, to the American Consul. His family followed. His mother-in-law and young son escaped to Finland. His wife was imprisoned and only after a cable from Senator William Borah was able to join them in Finland and come to the United States. He taught at Dartmouth from <a href="articles/1925.html">1925</a> to <a href="articles/1927.html">1927</a>, when he left to became assistant professor of mathematics at Brown. He was promoted to professor the next year. In <a href="articles/1940.html">1940</a> he became co-editor of <i>Mathematical Reviews,</i> published at Brown. While on leave of absence for his health, he died in Bethesda, Maryland, on November 18, <a href="articles/1945.html">1945</a>.</p>
