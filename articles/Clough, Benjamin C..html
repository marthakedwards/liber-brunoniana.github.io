<p>Benjamin Crocker Clough (<a href="articles/1889.html">1889</a>-<a href="articles/1975.html">1975</a>), professor of <a href="articles/English.html">English</a> and classics, was born in Tisbury on the island of Martha’s Vineyard on November 19, <a href="articles/1889.html">1889</a>. He went “off island” to continue his education at Harvard, where he received his A.B. degree in <a href="articles/1911.html">1911</a>, his A.M. in <a href="articles/1918.html">1918</a>, and his Ph.D. in <a href="articles/1921.html">1921</a> for a study of the writings of John Donne. He served as assistant in the <a href="articles/English.html">English</a> Department at Brown from <a href="articles/1913.html">1913</a> to <a href="articles/1915.html">1915</a>, instructor from <a href="articles/1915.html">1915</a> to <a href="articles/1917.html">1917</a> and again from <a href="articles/1920.html">1920</a> to <a href="articles/1922.html">1922</a>, and was promoted to assistant professor in <a href="articles/1922.html">1922</a>. He left the <a href="articles/English.html">English</a> Department for <a href="articles/Classics.html">Classics</a> in <a href="articles/1924.html">1924</a> as assistant professor of Greek and Latin classics, and became associate professor in <a href="articles/1926.html">1926</a>, head of the <a href="articles/Classics.html">Classics</a> Department in <a href="articles/1929.html">1929</a>, and David Benedict professor in <a href="articles/1930.html">1930</a>. He published <i>The American Imagination at Work,</i> an anthology of folk tales, and <i>Tall Tales and Folk Tales,</i> both in <a href="articles/1947.html">1947</a>. His own imagination was often at work, as some of his articles in scholarly journals were ascribed to <a href="articles/Carberry, Josiah S..html">Josiah Carberry</a> (q.v). Clough, an intimate of Carberry from his beginning, was the curator of the papers of that ubiquitous professor, and, although the <i>Providence Journal</i> refused to print items about Carberry, it did accept over twelve hundred book reviews by Ben Clough. He retired in <a href="articles/1949.html">1949</a>. He died on August 30, <a href="articles/1975.html">1975</a> in Smithfield, Rhode Island.</p>
