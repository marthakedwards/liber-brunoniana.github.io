<p><i>Yang Lang,</i> subtitled “an illustrated journal devoted to burlesque and light literature” came out in March <a href="articles/1869.html">1869</a> in a four-page newspaper format, announcing that it would be published monthly by the students of Brown University during the academic year. The second issue had eight pages and a two-page supplement, and succeeding numbers grew to twelve pages. The literature was, as promised, light. There were a few jokes and “exchanges” of news from other colleges and, beginning with the second issue, two or more pages of advertisements. The final issue appeared in January <a href="articles/1870.html">1870</a>.</p>
