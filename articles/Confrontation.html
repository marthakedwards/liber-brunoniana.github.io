<p><i>Confrontation</i> was a periodical which appeared for only two issues in <a href="articles/1967.html">1967</a>. Its statement of purpose declared, “It seeks to act as a forum in which radicals can express the thoughts which underlie their slogans and symbolic acts. And it is offered in the belief that the Brown Community can well profit from exposure to a measure of sober dissent.” While neither editors nor sponsorship was stated, this introduction carried the signatures of Brett Gorkin ’69, Chris Coles ’69, David Williams, and David Kertzer ’69. The second and last issue was chiefly devoted to anti-Vietnam War sentiment.</p>
