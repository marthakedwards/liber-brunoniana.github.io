Gurney said:</p><blockquote>“Professor Albert Knight Potter was a charter member of The University Club. For nearly fifty years he used it as a second home. He was one of our consistent billiard players, and was adept at bridge and at conversation. His gracious courtesy, his broad sense of humor, and his good manners left their impress upon all who shared in his company. In these days of hasty and slipshod language, how we respect one who spoke with clarity, assurance, and impeccable taste!”</blockquote>
