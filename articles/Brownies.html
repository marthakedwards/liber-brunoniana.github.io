<p>Brownies was an all-college society of the Women’s College founded in <a href="articles/1904.html">1904</a> to promote college spirit and to foster the relationship between the undergraduates and the alumnae by social activities such as dances, stunts, and <a href="articles/May Day.html">May Day</a> festivities. A Brownie “stunt” might be a Hallowe’en party or a play written by a student. In the beginning meetings were held every two weeks at <a href="articles/Slater Memorial Homestead.html">Slater Memorial Homestead</a> until the residents of the dormitory objected to their frequent presence, at which time they were obliged to rent <a href="articles/Pembroke Hall.html">Pembroke Hall</a> for meetings and could afford to meet only once a month. The Brownies continued to sponsor parties, athletic events, and dramatic presentations, and fostered class spirit at an interclass stunt night. In <a href="articles/1956.html">1956</a>, when Brown and Pembroke began to cooperate in social activities, the name of the society was changed to the Pembroke Social Organization.</p>
