<p>The <i>George Street Journal,</i> is a weekly publication of the Brown News Bureau, which informs the University community about important events, campus news and policies, and accomplishments of faculty and students. It also provides a calendar of events. The first <i>Brown University <a href="articles/Calendar.html">Calendar</a></i> appeared in October <a href="articles/1913.html">1913</a>, with an announcement that it would be published every Friday during the college year. A subscription to the <i><a href="articles/Calendar.html">Calendar</a></i> was available at one dollar per year. The Publicity Committee announced in October <a href="articles/1915.html">1915</a> that publication would be temporarily suspended. Two weeks later the <i><a href="articles/Calendar.html">Calendar</a></i> began to be issued as a supplement to the <i>Brown Daily Herald</i> on Saturdays during term time, an arrangement which continued until June <a href="articles/1917.html">1917</a>. Another calendar, which began in September <a href="articles/1930.html">1930</a> as the <i>Brown University Weekly <a href="articles/Calendar.html">Calendar</a>,</i> changed its name abruptly in December <a href="articles/1932.html">1932</a> to <i>Brown University Weekly Bulletin,</i> and continued under that title, even after it had changed to biweekly publication and adopted a newspaper format in January <a href="articles/1976.html">1976</a>. This change, following <a href="articles/President.html">President</a> <a href="articles/Hornig, Donald F..html">Donald Hornig</a>’s desire, as noted in his inaugural address, to “help develop a community understanding of issues of wider concern as well as a deeper appreciation of what is going on and being thought about at Brown,” gave expanded coverage to campus events and added news of general interest to the University community. Since September <a href="articles/1980.html">1980</a>, the paper has been called <i>The George Street Journal,</i> a name connected with the location of its publisher, the Brown News Bureau, which was selected after a naming contest announced the previous December had brought forth nearly a hundred suggestions. Publication of the <i>George Street Journal,</i> suspended in September <a href="articles/1991.html">1991</a> for budgetary reasons, was resumed one year later, this time as a weekly paper.</p>
