<p>Kassar House at 151 Thayer Street, now occupied by the Department of <a href="articles/Mathematics.html">Mathematics</a>, was formerly used by the Computer Sciences Department. The three-story house was built in <a href="articles/1884.html">1884</a> by Nancy Bishop, sister-in-law of the wife of General Ambrose Burnside. Mrs. Bishop died two years later and left the house to her daughter. It was bought in <a href="articles/1920.html">1920</a> by Frank Hinckley and in <a href="articles/1930.html">1930</a> by William Viall. Brown acquired the building in <a href="articles/1977.html">1977</a> from Richmond Viall, and named it Edward W. Kassar House in recognition of funds given in <a href="articles/1982.html">1982</a> by Raymond E. Kassar â€™48. The Gould Laboratory, a brick addition to Kassar House was built in <a href="articles/1982.html">1982</a> to provide a much needed computer science laboratory including the Foxboro Auditorium with tiers of worktables and computers for classroom instruction in computer science. The laboratory was named for Gould Inc., an Illinois-based electronics company whose Gould Inc. Foundation contributed $500,000 toward construction costs. The auditorium was named for the Foxboro Company of Foxboro, Massachusetts, specialist in process control systems, which contributed another $150,000. In <a href="articles/1990.html">1990</a> the two existing sections were integrated into a new <a href="articles/Mathematics.html">Mathematics</a> Building designed by William Kite Architects, and Gould Laboratory, no longer a laboratory, became Gould Annex.</p>
